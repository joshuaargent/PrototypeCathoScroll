  category: 'God',

  question: 'Who made you?',

  answer:
    'God made me.',

  explanation:
    'This simple answer teaches one of the most important truths of the Catholic faith: we are not accidents. Every human person exists because God freely chose to create them. God knows each person, loves each person, and wills their existence. Because we are created by God, every human life possesses inherent dignity and value that cannot be taken away by success, failure, wealth, ability, or social status. Understanding that God made us helps us understand who we are and why we are here. We belong to God, depend upon Him for everything, and are called to live in a relationship with Him. Recognising God as our Creator should lead us to gratitude, humility, worship, and trust in His loving plan for our lives.',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'Why did God make you?',

  answer:
    'God made me to know him, love him and serve him in this world, and to be happy with him for ever in the next.',

  explanation:
    'This answer summarises the purpose of human life. God did not create us without purpose or direction. He created us so that we might enter into a relationship with Him. We come to know God through faith, prayer, Scripture, and the teaching of the Church. We show our love for God through worship, obedience, and charity towards others. We serve God by living according to His commandments and using our gifts for His glory. Earthly life is therefore a preparation for eternal life. While many people search for happiness in possessions, achievements, or pleasure, the deepest fulfilment of the human heart is found only in God. The goal of the Christian life is not merely to be a good person but to share forever in the life and happiness of God in Heaven.',

    paragraphs: ['1', '27', '1721'],
    text: 'God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. The desire for God is written in the human heart because man is created by God and for God. God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him, and so to come to paradise.'

  slug: 'image-and-likeness-of-god',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'To whose image and likeness did God make you?',

  answer:
    'God made me to his own image and likeness.',

  explanation:
    'Being made in the image and likeness of God gives every human person a unique dignity. Unlike animals and the rest of creation, human beings are capable of reason, free choice, love, and relationship with God. The image of God is present in every person from conception until natural death and is the foundation of human dignity. Although sin wounded humanity, it did not destroy this image. Through Jesus Christ, we are called not only to reflect God more clearly in this life but also to be transformed by grace and ultimately share in His glory. The Church therefore teaches that every human person deserves respect and protection because each person bears the image of their Creator.',

    paragraphs: ['355', '356', '1700'],

  },

  scripture: {
    reference: 'Genesis 1:26-27',

  slug: 'is-the-likeness-in-body-or-soul',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'Is this likeness to God in your body, or in your soul?',

  answer:
    'This likeness to God is chiefly in my soul.',

  explanation:
    'God is pure spirit and does not possess a physical body. Therefore, the deepest way in which we resemble God is not through our physical appearance but through our spiritual nature. Human beings possess intellect and free will, allowing them to know truth, love goodness, and freely choose how they act. These spiritual powers reflect God in a unique way. While the human body is good and created by God, it is the soul that primarily bears His image and likeness. The soul enables us to enter into communion with God, receive His grace, and respond freely to His call. This truth reminds us that human dignity comes from more than outward appearance, strength, intelligence, or worldly success.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['363', '1703', '1711'],
    text: 'In Sacred Scripture the term soul often refers to human life or the entire human person. The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and spiritual. Endowed with a spiritual and immortal soul, the human person is ordered to God.'

  slug: 'how-is-your-soul-like-to-god',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'How is your soul like to God?',

  answer:
    'My soul is like to God because it is a spirit, and it is immortal.',

  explanation:
    'Unlike our bodies, which are material and subject to death, the soul is spiritual. Because it is a spirit, the soul is capable of knowing God, loving God, and entering into friendship with Him. The soul is also immortal, meaning that it does not cease to exist when the body dies. At death, the soul continues to live and awaits the final resurrection of the body. This truth gives immense dignity to every human person because each soul has an eternal destiny. Catholics believe that earthly life is not the end of our existence but the beginning of a journey that continues forever. The immortality of the soul reminds us that our choices matter, our relationship with God matters, and that we are created not merely for this life but for eternity. Through sanctifying grace, the soul is prepared to share forever in the life and happiness of God in Heaven.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['363', '366', '1703'],
    text: 'The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and spiritual. The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God and is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body at death.'
  },

  slug: 'what-does-it-mean-that-your-soul-is-immortal',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'What do you mean when you say that your soul is immortal?',

  answer:
    'When I say my soul is immortal, I mean that my soul can never die.',

  explanation:
    'The soul is immortal because it is spiritual rather than material. While the body experiences death and returns to the earth, the soul continues to exist. Catholics believe that every person will live forever, either in perfect union with God or separated from Him by their own free choice. Death is therefore not the end of existence but the beginning of eternity. This truth gives great importance to the choices we make in this life. Because the soul survives death, our relationship with God matters far more than temporary earthly success or pleasure. The immortality of the soul also gives Christians hope when facing death, reminding them that God created human beings for eternal life. At the end of time, Christ will raise the dead and reunite each soul with a glorified body, completing Gods plan for His children.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['366', '988', '1016'],
    text: 'The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body at death. By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our transformed body.'

  slug: 'why-must-you-take-care-of-your-soul',

  category: 'God',

  question: 'Of which must you take more care, of your body or of your soul?',

  answer:
    'I must take more care of my soul; for Christ has said, "What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and suffers the loss of his soul?"',

  explanation:
    'The body is a gift from God and should be respected and cared for, but the soul is even more important because it is immortal and destined for eternity. Many people spend enormous effort pursuing wealth, success, comfort, appearance, or popularity while neglecting their relationship with God. Jesus teaches that no earthly achievement can compensate for the loss of ones soul. Caring for the soul means praying regularly, receiving the sacraments, avoiding sin, growing in virtue, and seeking God in daily life. A healthy body is valuable, but even the healthiest body will eventually die. The soul, however, will live forever. Christians are therefore called to give first place to God and to the spiritual life, knowing that eternal realities are more important than temporary earthly concerns.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['1691', '1810', '2548'],
    text: 'Christian, recognize your dignity and now that you share in Gods own nature, do not return to your former base condition by sinning. The desire for true happiness frees man from attachment to the goods of this world.'
  },

  id: '8',

  slug: 'what-must-you-do-to-save-your-soul',

  category: 'Salvation',

  question: 'What must you do to save your soul?',

  answer:
    'To save my soul I must worship God by Faith, Hope and Charity; that is, I must believe in him, I must hope in him, and I must love him with my whole heart.',

  explanation:
    'God desires the salvation of every person and provides the grace necessary for us to reach Heaven. The Christian life is built upon the three theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Through Faith we believe what God has revealed. Through Hope we trust in Gods promises and seek eternal life. Through Charity we love God above all things and love our neighbour for His sake. These virtues are gifts from God that are strengthened through prayer, the sacraments, and faithful Christian living. Salvation is not simply about knowing facts about God but about entering into a living relationship with Him. As believers grow in Faith, Hope, and Charity, they become more fully united to Christ and better equipped to persevere in holiness throughout their lives.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['1812', '1813', '1822'],
    text: 'The human virtues are rooted in the theological virtues, which adapt mans faculties for participation in the divine nature. The theological virtues are faith, hope, and charity. Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake.'
  },

  scripture: {
    reference: '1 Corinthians 13:13',
    text: 'So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.'

  slug: 'what-is-faith',

  category: 'Salvation',

  question: 'What is faith?',

  answer:
    'Faith is a supernatural gift of God, which enables us to believe without doubting whatever God has revealed.',

  explanation:
    'Faith is much more than a feeling or personal opinion. It is a gift from God that enables us to accept as true everything that He has revealed. Because God is perfectly truthful, Catholics trust His word even when some mysteries exceed human understanding. Faith does not oppose reason; rather, it perfects and elevates it. Through faith we come to know God, accept His promises, and place our trust in Jesus Christ. Faith is received as a gift but must be freely embraced and continually nourished. Prayer, Scripture, study, and participation in the sacraments help faith to grow stronger. Without faith it is impossible to please God fully because faith is the foundation upon which the entire Christian life is built.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['153', '154', '1814'],
    text: 'Faith is a supernatural virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, because he is truth itself. By faith man freely commits his entire self to God.'
  },

  scripture: {
    reference: 'Hebrews 11:1',
    text: 'Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.'

  slug: 'why-must-you-believe-what-god-has-revealed',

  category: 'Salvation',

  question: 'Why must you believe whatever God has revealed?',

  answer:
    'I must believe whatever God has revealed because God is the very truth, and can neither deceive nor be deceived.',

  explanation:
    'Catholic faith rests ultimately on the trustworthiness of God Himself. Human beings can make mistakes, misunderstand facts, or even intentionally deceive others. God, however, is perfect truth. Because He knows all things perfectly and possesses absolute goodness, He can never lie or be mistaken. When God reveals something for our salvation, Christians can accept it with complete confidence. This certainty does not arise from our own intelligence but from Gods authority. Even when certain teachings are difficult to understand, believers trust the God who has revealed them. The act of faith is therefore an act of trust in Gods wisdom, goodness, and truthfulness. Believing what God has revealed draws us into a deeper relationship with Him and allows us to build our lives on a foundation that cannot fail.',

  catechism: {
    paragraphs: ['156', '157', '215'],
    text: 'What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed truths appear as true and intelligible in the light of our natural reason, but the authority of God himself who reveals them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. God is the fullness of Truth.'
  },

  scripture: {
    reference: 'Titus 1:2',
    text: 'In hope of eternal life which God, who never lies, promised ages ago.'
